-> Google Cloud Storage for Object Storage
-> Container Registry for storing container images
-> Cloud Filestore if app requires managed Network Attached Storage(NAS)
-> If app needs block storage, use Persistent disks

Volumes
*******
-> Volumes are storage accessible to containers in a Pod

Types of Volumes
****************
1. emptyDir
-> Ephemeral volume type that provides an empty directory that containers in the pod can read and write from
-> Data is deleted when pod is deleted
-> Useful for scratch space and sharing data between multiple containers in a Pod

2. configMap
-> Configuration data is made accessible to applications
-> Files in a configMap volume are specified by a configMap resource

3. secret
-> Sensitive data such as passwords, OAuth tokens and SSH keys are made accessible to the applications

4. downwardAPI

5. persistentVolumeClaim
-> Cluster operators can provision durable storage to be used by applications
-> A Pod uses a PersistentVolumeClaim to mount a Volume that is backed by this durable storage

PersistentVolume
****************
-> Cluster resources that pods can use for durable storage
-> PersistentVolumes are cluster resources that exist independently of Pods
-> PersistentVolume resources can be provisioned dynamically through PersistentVolumeClaims

PersistentVolumeClaim
*********************
-> PVC is a request for and claim to a PersistentVolume resource
-> PersistentVolumeClaim objects request a specific size, access mode, and StorageClass for the PersistentVolume


-> Portability is another advantage of using PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims


Access Modes

-> ReadWriteOnce
-> ReadOnlyMany
